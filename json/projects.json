        "description": "Company project carried out at Cristec consisting of developing and implementing a reliable UART communication protocol between an ESP32-C3 microcontroller and an STM32F0. The specifications required a 100 ms exchange period, but optimization of the code, interrupt handling, and use of DMA (Direct Memory Access) on both microcontrollers made it possible to achieve an effective speed of 6 ms, while ensuring data integrity verification via CRC control.",
